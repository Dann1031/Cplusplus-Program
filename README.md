# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, we made a two working time clocks. One set in a 12hr and another set as a 24hr (military time). 

#What did you do particularly well?
With this being my first C++ project, I did not do very well. The code could not run properly. The only thing I believe I did well
on this was format the code properly. Making it work and writing the right code was the issue.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code in many ways. Format, varibles, statements. I feel like once I understand these a little bit more, 
my knowledge for coding in C++ will be lot better. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
If I am being honest, I found the whole thing challenging. Using Zybookz I feel like went too fast. I feel like we were thrown into parts of coding in C++ that came out of no where. Trying to complete 2 weeks of zybooks in one week was really difficult when weeks had 20+ sections in them. The way I overcame this was by using Youtube and Google. I aslo went back on parts of th code that we worked on through zybooks to try to get a better understanding of the code I was righting. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Even though I have alot of studying to do on C++, the skills that I will be working on that will particularly transferable to other projects or course work are the ablilty to read and write clean code. Well written code. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by creating comments on almost every line of code to give the reader an understanding
of what that line of code is intended to do.
